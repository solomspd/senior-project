# Machine learning decompilation

Although reverse engineering a binary program has a rather mature ecosystem of tools such as ghidra and binary ninja, they all still involve large amount of manual time and effort to bring back some sense of strcuture and human readablity to the assembly code.
Here, machine learning offers an opportunity to dramatically automate this process.

# Overview

Here we propose a means of decompiling binary blobs and executables back into human readable C code.

# Contribution
This is an area not too explored and we have yet to see more nuanced approaches applied to decompilation.
